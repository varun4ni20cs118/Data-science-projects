<h1>Used Car Price Prediction Project</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This repository contains code and resources for a used car price prediction project using machine learning tools and the linear regression algorithm. The project also includes a frontend API built with Streamlit for interactive user interface.</p>

<h2>Data</h2>
<p>The dataset used in this project contains information about various used cars, including features such as Price, kms_driven, years, car_name, fuel_type, and more.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python 3.x</li>
  <li>Jupyter Notebook (for running the code)</li>
  <li>Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn</li>
  <li>Streamlit (for running the frontend API)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<code>git https://github.com/varun4ni20cs118/used-car-price-prediction.git</code>

<h2>Project Structure</h2>
<ul>
  <li><code>data/</code>: Contains the dataset used in the project.</li>
  <li><code>used_car_price_prediction.ipynb</code>: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training (linear regression), and evaluation.</li>
  <li><code>requirements.txt</code>: List of required Python libraries for easy installation.</li>
  <li><code>app.py</code>: Streamlit app for the frontend API.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The machine learning model, based on linear regression, achieved [insert performance metrics here] on the test set, indicating its ability to predict used car prices effectively.</p>

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
<p>Possible future improvements for this project include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Exploring advanced machine learning algorithms for better prediction accuracy.</li>
  <li>Enhancing feature engineering techniques to capture more nuances in the data.</li>
  <li>Implementing error detection techniques to identify and handle outliers or anomalies in the data.</li>
  <li>Improving the frontend interface with additional features and visualizations.</li>
</ul>
